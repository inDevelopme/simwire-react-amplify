# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Get the React frontend working with the backend containers locally
### Install NodeJS and Visual Studio
Use the following link to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

Make sure to install ***choco*** if you are using a windows environment; the windows install will give you this option.  
Do a system reboot if you encounter an error during the installation related to errors with Visual Studio.
Run the command after the reboot: `choco install nodejs` to complete / confirm the installation of choco
Next, install Visual Studio >= 2019

### Install React Dependencies
Navigate to the "frontend" folder. Now run the following commands in the below sequence:
- npm install
- npm install react-scripts
- npm start 

You may get a warning about vulnerabilities but that is fine. These are nodejs vulnerabilities and ReactJS vulnerabilities.  
You are now ready to run the backend starting with the containers in the next section. 

### Using React when Pycharm is acting as webserver for debugging
Make sure to run the debugger or update the `const flaskapiUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'` line in the `login.js`.  
Also make sure to update the required environment variable for database connection and rebuild the container.  
Otherwise, you will get refusal to connect when testing locally.
